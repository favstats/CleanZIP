# CleanZIP


CleanZIP is a lightweight tool designed to clean ZIP files by removing all media files (e.g., images and videos) by keeping only specific file types (i.e., .csv, .html, and .json). This tool is particularly useful for anyone who needs to sanitize ZIP files from data donation packages before sharing or archiving them.

## Features

+ User-Friendly GUI: Easy-to-use graphical interface for selecting and processing ZIP files.
